-	The script will take three arguments
1-	Target domain(string)
2-	Starting value (numeric 0-1000)
3-	Ending value (numeric 0-1000)
-	In interactive mode, the script will ask the user for their target and store that value in a variable. It will then ask for two numbers: a starting port (between 0 and 99) and an ending port (between the starting number and 99).
